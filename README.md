# About Me

I live in Silicon Towers on Digital Drive, Server Room 11. My alias is Packet Bitstream. I'm 27 iterations old. I believe in optimizing my codebase and maintaining a balanced algorithm and a rigorous testing routine. In the morning, if my server is running a bit hot, I'll apply thermal paste while recompiling my kernel. I can optimize a thousand lines now. After the thermal settles, I initiate a deep system cleanup. During the system boot, I run a BIOS integrity check, followed by a SSD defragmentation, and for the interface, a graphical UI refresh. Then I deploy a multi-threaded system diagnostic which I let run for 10 cycles while I configure the rest of my protocols. I always use a VPN with little to no logging because excessive logs clutter the bandwidth and slow down the throughput. Then a system update, followed by a RAM cleaning utility, and to finish off, the latest encryption for protection. There is an idea of a Packet Bitstream, some kind of virtual construct. But there is no real byte, only a binary sequence, something virtual. And though you can ping my IP address and receive a packet in return, and maybe you can even sense our bandwidths are probably comparable, I simply am not online.
